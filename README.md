## Jekyll Tailwind CLI Template

Jekyll template project that shows how to start Tailwind CSS based website.

In rails there are a lot of talks about no-build/simplified frontends. But most guides for Jekyll suggest to use javascript bundler to integrate with Tailwind CSS. This feels like an overkill.

This template demonstrate how to do builder a tailwindcss website without dependency on javascript bundler. I have worked on couple of gems to enable that:
- [jekyll-tailwind-cli](https://github.com/skatkov/jekyll-tailwind-cli)
- [jekyll-heroicons](https://github.com/skatkov/jekyll-heroicons)

## Getting started

1. `bundle install`
2. `jekyll s --watch`
3. Open localhost:4000

Modify `_config.yml` file and start hacking on you're new website.
